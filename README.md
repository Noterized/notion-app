# notion-app 64-bit
Linux notion.so app <br>
Currently this is a work in progress. At this time it allows you to run a 64 bit electron app of Notion.so on your desktop.
* Due to size limits on Github you need to unpack the `packagebinary.tar.xz` inside the `notion-app` directory.
* A script has been provided to create the "notion.desktop" file run `./create_desktop_file.sh`.
* The script now places "Notion.desktop" file in your `.local/share/applications` folder.
* If you are running arch or have issues launching the notion-app make sure you have `libgconf-2` installed.

Thank you for trying it out.
