 # Notion-app
Linux notion.so app <br>
Currently this is a work in progress. At this time it allows you to run an electron app of Notion.so on your desktop.
* A script has been provided to create the "notion.desktop" file run `./create_desktop_file.sh`.
* The script now places "Notion.desktop" file in your `.local/share/applications` folder.
* If you are running arch or have issues launching the notion-app make sure you have `libgconf-2` installed.


<br>
This is an Electron wrapper of notion.so for linux. 

#### There is an updated build in the x64 branch that needs to be tested but does work.

<br>
There is no support from notion.so there is no offline functions; only online use.
<br>
Thank you for trying it out.
