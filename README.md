 # notion-app
Linux notion.so app <br>
Currently this is a work in progress. At this time it allows you to run an electron app of Notion.so on your desktop.
* A script has been provided to create the "notion.desktop" file run `./create_desktop_file.sh`.
* The script now places "Notion.desktop" file in your `.local/share/applications` folder.
* If you are running arch or have issues launching the notion-app make sure you have `libgconf-2` installed.

Thank you for trying it out.

This is an Electron wrapper of notion.so for linux. 
But as of yet notion.so has still not built integration for or adopted the use of this project. I have reached out to them and recieved responses. Their feedback has been intresting but not postive.

As there is no support from notion.so to continue beyond personal online use.
