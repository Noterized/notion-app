# notion-app
Linux notion.so app <br>
Currently this is a work in progress. At this time it allows you to run an electron app of Notion.so on your desktop.
* A script has been provided to create the "notion.desktop" file run `./create_desktop_file.sh`.
* The script now places "Notion.desktop" file in your `.local/share/applications` folder.
* If you are running arch or have issues launching the notion-app make sure you have `libgconf-2` installed.

Thank you for trying it out.

At this time if you are still able to use this Electron PORT of notion for linux then that is great. But notion.so is still refusing to build ingration for or adopt the use of this project.
I will be releasing a rebuild with support for EL v7 but there is no plan to extend this beyond that point. AS I have no support from the notion to continue beyond personal use.
